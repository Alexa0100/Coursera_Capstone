I will be using the shared data in part one of this capstone project to predict accident severity. It is supervised data meaning that the machine learning output will learn based on inputs with known outputs. 

The target variable is “Severity Code” which measures the severity of an accident from 0 to 5 within the dataset. 

Attributes used to calculate the severity of an accident are weather, road conditions, and light conditions.
